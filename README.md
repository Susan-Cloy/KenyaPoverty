This project was inspired by the article "Using publicly available satellite imagery and deep learning to understand economic well-being in Africa" published in *Nature Communications* on May 22, 2020 ([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16185-w)).

For the most part It uses Landsat imagery acquired from Google Earth Engine API and Kenya's dhs survey data for the years 2014 and 2015.
